## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our browser automation bridge seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not report it via a public GitHub issue.

Instead, please report vulnerabilities privately by:

1.  Opening a **Private Vulnerability Report** on GitHub (if available for this repo).
2.  Or emailing the maintainer directly at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS].

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce (proof of concept).
- Potential impact.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix if necessary.
